# Typing Test

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by my own journey learning to touch-type. I looked around the web for various typing tests, finding a pretty wide array of options, but none that both felt good to use and look at. Furthermore, I thought it would be interesting to build it using React Context and Hooks. So here we are, with my own take on the classic typing test. This is a work in progress, and likely will see only sporadic updates.
